As a 

developer, 

I 

need to specify multiple subjects for an OAuth request so that an AI agent can participate in a group chat channel or a voice meeting and access only protected resources to which all members of the meeting or channel have access

so that

AI agents can use tools to respond to prompts in a team context without disclosing information that any team members should not have access to.

For example,

A CEO is meeting with his leadership team. He has access to salary data, but they do not. The team asks the AI a variety of financial questions, and it responds only with information that every member of the team has access to.
